# P20_Customer-Purchase-Patterns-Analysis

**VERSION 1**

**A. Project Overview**

- This project applies Market Basket Analysis on the Online Retail dataset to uncover product associations and identify opportunities for cross-selling and bundling.

**B. Dataset Information**

_**Source**_

- Online Retail Data Set from UCI ML repo
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jihyeseo/online-retail-data-set-from-uci-ml-repo

**_Period_**

- Data covers the period December 2010 to June 2011

**C. Methodology**

- Data Cleaning:
  + Column Type:
    - CustomerID: float ‚Üí Convert to string
  + %Blank:
    - CustomerID missing ~25% ‚Üí Drop missing rows
    - Description missing ~0.27% ‚Üí Fill missing rows by "Unknow"
  + Outliers:
    - Quantity: 10.82% ‚Üí Drop rows which have Quantity <= 0
    - UnitPrice: 7.31% ‚Üí Drop rows which have UnitPrice <= 0
  + Duplicate: 0.97% ‚Üí Drop duplicate rows
  + Convert 'StockCode' column to String
- Export Cleaned Data
- Use FPGrowth for Market Basket Analysis

**D. Key Findings & Actionable Plans**

_**Key Findings**_

- Although three ranking tables were generated (by Support, Confidence, and Lift), this project focuses primarily on Lift for deriving insights:
  + Support only shows how frequently items appear, but in this dataset, even the top itemsets have support <3%. Hence, support values are too low to reveal meaningful patterns.
  + Confidence indicates the probability of buying B given A, but it can be misleading if item A is rare. For example, very high confidence may arise simply because a niche item always appears with another, not because of a strong relationship.
  + Lift corrects for this by measuring how much stronger the co-occurrence of A and B is compared to random chance. A lift >> 1 reveals a true association.
‚Üí Therefore, Lift is the most reliable measure here. With values exceeding 50, the results highlight extremely strong product associations such as:
- Regency Tea Collection (Plates, Jugs, Bowls) almost always purchased together ‚Üí strong bundle potential. Customers mix colors (Green ‚Üî Pink ‚Üî Roses) instead of sticking with one color, showing cross-color affinity.
- Poppy‚Äôs Playhouse series (Bedroom, Kitchen, Livingroom) consistently appear together ‚Üí strong case for upselling full playhouse kits.

_**Actionable Plans**_

- Bundle Strategy - Regency Tea Collection:
  + Promote themed bundles by color (e.g., Green + Pink).
  + Offer small discounts (5‚Äì10%) for purchasing the entire set.
- Cross-Selling - Poppy‚Äôs Playhouse Series:
  + Online: add ‚ÄúFrequently Bought Together‚Äù suggestions when a customer selects one item.
  + Offline: display Kitchen, Bedroom, Livingroom items together to encourage full-set purchases.
